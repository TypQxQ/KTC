[gcode_macro M116]
description: T<index> P<index> H<index> S<temperature> W<Tolerance>
  Alias for M109.
  Waits for all temperatures, or a specified tool or heater's temperature.
  This command can be used without any additional parameters.
  Without parameters it waits for bed and current extruder.
  Defaults to 1*C for faster response. Newer hardware is not as sensitive.

  T= Tool number (optional, defaults to the currently selected tool).
  P= Tool number (Same as T. Use one or the other, not both).
  H= Heater number, optional. Defaults to 0. If H is specified, P and T are ignored.
  S= Temperature in degC to wait for. Used together with P or T. The command will set the active temperature of the specified tool to this value and set the tool to active mode.
  W= Tolerance in degC, optional. Wait will wait until heater is between set temperature +/- tolerance.
